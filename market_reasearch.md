# 🦷 Researching Invisalign

---

## I. Research Process

1. **Platforms for Market Feedback**  
   - Reddit, Quora, and Google are top sources for gathering raw market feedback and audience sentiment.

2. **Ad Library Research**  
   - Explore the Facebook Ad Library to understand competition and market sophistication.  
   - Identify how many competitors exist, what ad types are running, and what creative themes dominate.

3. **Pattern Recognition**  
   - Notice recurring trends.  
   - For Invisalign, there’s a strong *before-and-after* (transformation) theme.

4. **Audience Insights**  
   - Study what the audience is saying in comments and discussions:  
     - Are they **complaining**?  
     - What **concerns** or **benefits** come up repeatedly?

## II. Key Audience Desires & Pain Points

Common fears around Invisalign:
- Pain during treatment or maintenance  
- Discomfort about the process  
- Desire for simplicity and aesthetics  

Transform these into “I want” statements — they anchor ad concepts easily.

### Examples:
- “I want a **pain-free** way of getting a better smile.”  
- “I want a **non-intrusive** way of fixing my teeth.”  
- “I want a **cost-effective** way of improving my smile.”  
- “I want a **stain-free** smile — or maybe a free teeth whitening to finish the treatment.”  

**Tip:**  
Every desire or pain point → rewrite it as an **“I want” statement.**  
That becomes your creative foundation.

## III. Client Demographic

1. **Age Range:**  
   - Target: **27 and up** — working professionals with disposable income.

2. **Persona Themes:**  
   - Seeking convenience, confidence, and credibility.  
   - Likely skeptical of painful or overly complex treatments.

## IV. 5 Stages of Market Awareness

### **1. Unaware**
- **Who is this person?**  
  Doesn’t know they have a problem or won’t admit it.  
  This level is the hardest to sell to.  
- **Headline Goal:**  
  Sell *nothing.* Promise *nothing.*  
  Instead, echo a dissatisfaction they feel but can’t articulate.

---

### **2. Problem Aware**
- **State:**  
  Knows they have a problem but doesn’t connect it to your product.  
- **Headline Goal:**  
  Name the *need* or *solution* directly.  
  Dramatize it so clearly they see your product as the natural fix.

> “Your product becomes the *inevitable solution.*”

---

### **3. Solution Aware**
- **State:**  
  Knows what they want, but not that your product exists.  
- **Headline Goal:**  
  Name the desire and show it’s achievable.  
  Prove that your *mechanism* (how it works) delivers that outcome.

---

### **4. Product Aware**
- **State:**  
  Knows about your product but isn’t convinced yet.  
  *Most advertising happens here.*  
- **Headline Goal:**  
  Reinforce their desire.  
  Sharpen the image of your product fulfilling it.  
  Add new proof, documentation, or features.  
  Announce new mechanisms that make the product even better.

---

### **5. Most Aware**
- **State:**  
  Ready to buy but hasn’t acted.  
  *Bottom-of-funnel stage.*  
- **Headline Goal:**  
  Name the product and the price.  
  Make buying feel like an easy, obvious next step.

---

## V. Market Sophistication Stages

### **Stage 1 – First to Market**
- **Example:**  
  Prospects have never heard of a product like yours.  
  Market is in the 3rd or 4th level of awareness.  
- **Headline Strategy:**  
  Be *simple and direct.*  
  Name either the *need* or the *claim.*  
  Dramatize that claim, then use your product to prove it works.

---

### **Stage 2 – Second to Market**
- **Example:**  
  Product is still new, but competition exists.  
- **Headline Strategy:**  
  *Enlarge* successful claims.  
  Outdo your competitors.  
  Whoever can pay more to acquire a customer wins.

---

### **Stage 3 – Prospects Have Heard It All**
- **Example:**  
  Prospects are jaded; big claims no longer land.  
- **Headline Strategy:**  
  Shift focus from *what* the product does to *how* it does it.  
  Introduce a **new mechanism** — a unique process or technology.  
  A fresh mechanism makes old promises believable again.

---

### **Stage 4 – It’s Getting Crowded**
- **Example:**  
  Competitors are now copying your mechanism.  
- **Headline Strategy:**  
  Embellish your mechanism — show how it solves *more* of the problem.  
  But when claims push believability, you have two choices:  
  1. Introduce a new mechanism.  
  2. Move to the next stage.

---

### **Stage 5 – Reviving a Dead Product**
- **Example:**  
  Market no longer believes or cares about your advertising.  
  Similar to the *unaware* level of awareness.  
- **Headline Strategy:**  
  Use **identification instead of desire.**  
  Show your audience the version of themselves they *want* to be.  
  Use imagery to display social perception — how others will see them.  
  Anchor the brand in *values and identity.*  

> “What do you stand for that your market can get behind?  
> What do you stand against?”
