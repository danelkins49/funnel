Researching Invisalign

1. IE Reddit, Quora, Google in general are the best places for general market feedback/researc

2. Go through the ads library to understand competition and see the market sophistication

3. When doing research notice trends, IE Invislaign theres a lot of before an afters (transformation)

Understand how many competitors, ad types that are running

Also looking at what the audience is SAYING 
- are they complaining, common concerns, or benefits that are commonly talked about?

Invasliagn alot of people are fearing pain regarding the process and maintenance etc... 

HAVING A pain free treatment
"I want to have a pain free treatment"
"I want to hve a pain free way of getting a better smile"

Move all desires / painpoints to an "I want to statement"
much easier to build an ad concept around these statements

Client demopraphic
1. how old are people looking for this "solution" typically?
2. We're going to go for somebody thats 27/up in this invisalign case

"I want a cost effective way of fixing my smile"
"I want a pain free way of fixing my smile"
I want a stain free way to straigten my teeth? or throw in a "Free teeth whitening" after. 
Leave you with an aligned and white smile

Persona:
5 stages of market awareness

1. Unaware
i. Who is this person?
- The prospect is either not aware of his desire or wont honestly admit it without being led into it by your ad

This level is most difficult
ii. What does your headline need to do?
Sell Nothing. Promise nothing. Instead, your headline echoes a dissatisfaction that picks




2. Problem Aware
i. Knows he has a problem but doesnt see connection between fulfilling their need and your product
ii. Name the need and or solution in your headline - dramatize it so vividly that they see this your product as their solution

Your product is the inevitable solution



3. Solution Aware
i. Knows he wants what the product does but doesnt know the product exists
ii. Name the desire and or its solution in your headline
Prove that the solution you just named can be accomplished
Show that the. mechanism of that accomplishment is contained by your product





4. Product Aware
i. Knows of your product but doesnt want it yet. The bulk of advertising is here
ii. Reinforce their desire for your product
Sharpen his image of the way your product satisfies that desire
SHow where and when your product satisfies that desire
Introduce new proof/documentation of how well your product satisfies that desire
Announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy that desire





5. Most Aware
i. Wants to buy your product but hasnt gotten around to it

Bottom of funnel (they are likely already on your list)

ii. Name the product and the price

Market Sophistication


Stage 1 - You are first to market
Example :  Your prospects have never recieved any information about a product like yours before.. Your market is in the 3rd or 4th level of awareness

Headline Need : Your job is to get your market interested. Your story is brand new
Be simple and direct. Name either the need or claim in your headline. Dramatize that claim in your copy then bring in your product to prove that it works




Stage 2 - You are second to market
Example : You're second to market but your product is still new to the prospect
Headline : In this stage, ENLARGE the sucessful claim. Take it to the Limit. in other words, take your compeitition's claims and top them. THen outbid your compeitition to stay on top (Who ever can pay more to acquire a customer wins)


Stage 3 - Your prospects have heard it all
Example : In this stage your prospects have heard it all. They don't believe your old claims. You cant out exclaim your competitors
Your emphasis must shift from what the product does to HOW it does.

Headline : YOu need a new mechanism. Focus on the specific mechanism that makes your product the best. You are looking for a new process to make the old promises work.

A new mechanism will make the old claims seem fresh and believable again. Put your mechanism in your headline.


Stage 4- It's Getting Crowded
Example : Your competitors are now copying your mechanism
Headline : You need to embelish and make your mechanism solve MORE of the problem
However, at some point you will push your product claims beyond believability. At this point you have 2 options

1. Introduce a new mechanism
2. Move to the next stage


Stage 5 - Reviving a Dead Product
Your prospects no longer believe in your advertising. They no longer wish to be aware of your product

This stage is similar to the problems of the 5th level of awareness (unaware) The strategy to solve this problem is the same

Headline : You must now use identification instead of desire to bring your prospect into your ad
Show your market the version of themselves they want to be. Use images to show your market how others will view them when they use your product

What do you stand for that your market can get behind? What do you stand against?
