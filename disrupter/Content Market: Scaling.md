# 🎬 CONTENT MARKETING: SCALING

Source: [YouTube — How to Build a Scalable Content Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLruVbkkIxE)

---

## 🎯 GOAL

To create a **full-blown content engine** that:

1. Attracts new audiences  
2. Primes them with trust  
3. Makes ads cheaper, faster, and more scalable  
4. Produces **50+ content pieces** from a single long-form source  

> You don’t need to be a “content creator.”  
> You don’t need to go viral.  
> You just need a **system**.

---

## 🌱 SEED STRATEGY

### Core Idea
Take **one long-form piece of content** — such as:
- A podcast  
- An interview  
- A training session  

…and **turn it into dozens of assets** that power every channel you’re on.

### Possible Outputs
- A podcast episode  
- Dozens of captioned short-form videos  
- B-roll faceless content (with AI voiceover)  
- Emails, blog posts, and social captions  
- Even **ad copy** using the `3:2:2 Framework`

---

## ⚙️ PHASE 1: BUILDING LEVERAGE

### Step 1 — Upload to Descript
Use **Descript** as your transcription-based editing system.

Podcasts do what ads can’t:  
they give people time to **trust your tone, rhythm, and thought**.  
Once it’s out in the wild, you can **retarget those listeners** with ads.

Pull **quotes, clips, and transcriptions** to repurpose into:
- Short-form videos  
- AI training data (voice, tone, vocabulary)

---

## 🧰 TOOL STACK

### Descript
- Edit by text — highlight a word and delete it.  
- Features:
  - **Underlord:** removes filler words  
  - **Shorten Word Gaps**  
  - **Studio Sound:** removes background noise  
  - **Draft a Title / Summary / YouTube Description**

#### Prompt Example
[I have uploaded a transcript from a long-form content piece (interview).
Based on this transcript, find at least 10 short-form videos that would work well as Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, or TikToks.

Each video must be under 60 seconds and tied to a clear, popular subject — such as Facebook ads, creative testing, scaling strategy, AI, or content creation.

For each clip, give me:

A short title

A 1–2 sentence summary

The timestamp range

The hook or opening line

Focus on substance — useful to marketers or founders. Avoid fluff.]

### Submagic
- Generates captions, emojis, and word highlights automatically.  
- Turns **5–20 clips per session** into ready-to-post content.  
- Ideal when:
  - Testing multiple clips quickly  
  - Repurposing talking-head videos  
  - Maintaining consistent posting rhythm  
  - You want clean, dynamic captions without hiring an editor

---

### Captions.ai
- Adds animated captions and effects to make content pop visually.  
- Great for speeding up production while keeping quality high.

---

## 🧠 PRO TIPS
- Find your **unique font and filter** — make your vibe recognizable.  
- Use any relevant B-roll that complements your message.  
- Don’t overthink visuals — sometimes unexpected clips perform best.

> The goal: when someone sees your vibe, they instantly associate it with you.

## 🎞️ PHASE 2: FACELESS B-ROLL CONTENT

Tool: **ChatGPT + Disrupter School B-Roll Shorts Script Writer**

### Workflow
1. Upload transcription as a PDF.  
2. Specify:
   - Number of scripts: `1`  
   - Duration: `15s`, `30s`, or `45s`

#### Example Script Block
[Script]
Add the blocks to portions of the B-roll over time.

## 🚀 PHASE 3: DISTRIBUTION AT SCALE

Tool: **Repurpose.io**

### Flow Setup
1. **Choose Source:** e.g. “Short”  
2. Automate flows to publish content to:
   - YouTube Playlists  
   - TikTok  
   - Instagram  
   - Shorts / Reels feeds

> See 45:00 mark in the source video for flow setup context.

### Playlist Strategy
- When a video performs well, **add it to a second playlist** that triggers redistribution.  
- Repost top-performing clips every **2–3 weeks** — most followers haven’t seen them yet.  

> If it worked once, it’ll probably work again.
