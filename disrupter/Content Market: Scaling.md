# 🎬 CONTENT MARKETING: SCALING

Source: [YouTube — How to Build a Scalable Content Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLruVbkkIxE)

---

## 🎯 MISSION

Build a **content engine** that:
1. Attracts new audiences  
2. Builds trust before the sale  
3. Lowers ad costs and scales faster  
4. Generates **50+ assets** from one long-form source  

> No need to be a content creator or go viral — just follow the system.

---

## 🌱 SEED STRATEGY

### Step 1: Start with a Long-Form Source
Use one solid piece — a **podcast, interview, or training** — as your foundation.

### Step 2: Split it into Multi-Channel Assets
From that seed, extract:
- A podcast episode  
- Dozens of short-form clips  
- B-roll + AI voiceover content  
- Emails, blogs, and social posts  
- Ad copy built with the `3:2:2 Framework`

> One idea → many assets → endless distribution.

## ⚙️ PHASE 1: BUILD LEVERAGE

### Use Descript
Upload your long-form piece into **Descript**.  
It becomes your base for editing, clipping, and transcription.

Podcasts create trust faster than ads — tone, timing, and humanity.  
Once published, **retarget listeners** with your offers.

From the transcript, pull:
- Quotes  
- Clips  
- Subtopics for short-form videos or AI training

## 🧰 TOOL STACK

### 🧩 Descript
**What it does:**  
- Edit by text (delete filler words, shorten pauses)  
- Clean audio with *Studio Sound*  
- Auto-generate titles, summaries, and YouTube descriptions  

**Prompt Template:**
I’ve uploaded a transcript from a long-form piece (interview).
Find 10+ short-form videos for Reels, Shorts, or TikTok — under 60 seconds each — tied to topics like ads, scaling, AI, or content creation.

For each clip, include:

Short title

1–2 sentence summary

Timestamp range

Hook/opening line
Focus on substance. Avoid fluff.


---

### ⚡ Submagic
- Auto-captions with emojis, highlights, and animations  
- Generate 5–20 clips in one sitting  
- Ideal for repurposing talking-head content  
- Keeps posting consistent without hiring an editor  

---

### 🎨 Captions.ai
- Adds motion effects and polished caption styles  
- Simple tool for fast, clean, visual upgrades  

---

## 🧠 CREATIVE PRINCIPLES

- Pick one **font + filter** and use it everywhere — build instant recognition.  
- Use relevant B-roll, but don’t overthink — anything that matches the message works.  
- Repetition beats novelty. When people *see your vibe*, they should know it’s you.

---

## 🎞️ PHASE 2: FACELESS B-ROLL CONTENT

**Tools:** ChatGPT + Disrupter School B-Roll Script Writer

### Workflow
1. Upload the transcript as a PDF  
2. Choose script length: `15s`, `30s`, or `45s`  
3. Generate and layer the script over B-roll  

**Example Script Block:**
[Script]
Add the blocks to portions of the B-roll over time.

---

## 🚀 PHASE 3: DISTRIBUTION AT SCALE

**Tool:** Repurpose.io

### Flow Setup
1. Set “Short” as your source  
2. Auto-distribute clips to:
   - YouTube Shorts / Playlists  
   - TikTok  
   - Instagram Reels  

> See 45:00 in the video for full flow setup.

### Reposting Strategy
- When a clip performs, **add it to a “Top Content” playlist** for redistribution.  
- Repost high-performing videos every **2–3 weeks** — most followers missed them the first time.  

> If it hit once, it can hit again.
