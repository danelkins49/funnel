Inspiration Example (Indirect Competitor Ad Script)

You ever feel like your gym should be way more packed by now? You‚Äôve probably tried ads, boosting posts, maybe set up tents at an event. But it‚Äôs not adding up.  
The thing is, people are scrolling. Literally scrolling right now.  
And they‚Äôre driving past your place every single day.  
Looking for a place that actually cares. And you are that place.  
But if your offer is unclear and your ads just aren‚Äôt working right or, even worse, you‚Äôre invisible online, they‚Äôre never going to find you.  

It‚Äôs not your fault. You‚Äôve probably been trying to do everything yourself. Market, coach, sell, serve.  
But attention is currency now. And if you‚Äôre not capturing it, someone else is.  

That‚Äôs why I put together a free training for you that breaks down exactly how you can build a lead machine inside of your gym.  
One that runs 24/7 and actually brings in people that are already looking for you.  

To watch the training, go ahead and click the link down below. There‚Äôs no opt-in required on this one, so you‚Äôre set.  

When you do watch it, if it makes sense and you‚Äôre a real gym owner that‚Äôs not only smart but wants help installing this lead machine into your business today, fill out the form below the video.  
Book a call with our team and I‚Äôll see you on the other side.
