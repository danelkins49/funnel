## Determine ICP Emotional + Buyer State
Here’s my ICP.  

**Demographics (age, income, profession):** [fill in]  
**Financial position / resources:** [fill in]  
**Current behaviors (what they’re already doing with money/health/career):** [fill in]  
**Frustrations / complaints (the “why is my life like this” stuff):** [fill in]  
**Goals / desires (the “how do I solve this” stuff):** [fill in]  
**Emotional intensity (on a scale from 1–10, how panicked or calm are they?):** [fill in]  
**Buying mode (fear-driven, gain-driven, or optimization-driven?):** [fill in]  

Based on this, tell me:  
1. Which quadrant of the Emotional State Matrix they fall into (High/Low Emotion × Greed/Opportunity).  
2. Their inner dialogue (what they’re really saying to themselves).  
3. The most effective Big Idea angle (Exciting, Beneficial, Inevitable).  
4. The tone I should use in the funnel/VSL (urgent, calm, logical, inspiring, etc.).
