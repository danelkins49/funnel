# 🌌 META ANDROMEDA RETRIEVAL ENGINE  
### Context for Adaptation & AI-Assisted Funnel Building

---

## 🧭 1. Overview

**Andromeda** is Meta’s next-generation **Retrieval and Creative Optimization Engine**, replacing the traditional interest-based and rules-based ad delivery logic with a **retrieval-based AI system**.  
Instead of manually defined targeting, Andromeda *retrieves* and *matches* ads to users in real time based on creative signals, behavior, and predicted relevance.

In short — *the creative is now the audience.*

---

## ⚙️ 2. What Changed

| Old Meta System | Andromeda System |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Audience selection (interests, lookalikes) | Retrieval selection (creative–user match) |
| Algorithm optimized for conversion signals | Optimized for **creative diversity and predictive matching** |
| Manual A/B testing and segmentation | **Dynamic creative retrieval** across pools of assets |
| Pixel + event-based data dominance | **Creative embeddings + behavioral retrieval data** |
| Ads delivered to pre-set audiences | **Ads delivered to the most relevant users, regardless of targeting setup** |

---

## 🧩 3. Core Components

1. **Creative Embedding System**  
   - Every image, headline, and video is now converted into an *embedding* — a data representation of *meaning* (not just performance).  
   - The system learns *why* people respond to certain creative elements.

2. **Retrieval Model**  
   - Rather than searching a static audience, Andromeda retrieves the *best* ad from a massive creative pool based on predicted user response.  
   - The match happens in milliseconds.

3. **Diversity Scoring**  
   - Repetition is punished.  
   - Meta now scores ad accounts on **creative diversity**, rewarding brands that test multiple formats, tones, and emotional appeals.

4. **Unified Optimization Loop**  
   - Pixel, API conversions, and engagement data are fed into one retrieval loop — continuously refining creative-audience matching.

---

## 🧠 4. Strategic Implications

**a. Creative is the Targeting**  
You no longer “target” firefighters or veterans; you *teach Meta* what each persona looks and behaves like through diverse creative cues.

**b. Mechanism Over Message**  
Big claims alone fail; Andromeda rewards *mechanisms* — the *how* of your offer — because users engage longer when they understand process, not promise.

**c. Full-Funnel Creative Variety**  
Meta expects distinct creatives for each awareness level:  
- *Unaware*: curiosity hooks and storytelling  
- *Problem aware*: dramatize pain and introduce need  
- *Solution aware*: reveal mechanism  
- *Product aware*: proof and validation  
- *Most aware*: offer and urgency  

**d. Multi-Angle Ad Pools**  
Winning campaigns now rely on **clusters of angles**, not one winning ad.  
Feed Andromeda multiple creative types — testimonial, explainer, lifestyle, expert POV — to train retrieval strength.

---

## 🔍 5. How to Leverage It in Our Systems

1. **Incorporate Awareness & Sophistication Mapping**  
   Use frameworks from `creative_research_playbook.md` and `recipies.md` to plan creatives that cover each awareness stage.  
   → Feed these systematically into our AI creative generator.

2. **Adopt Creative Diversity Benchmarks**  
   Each campaign should maintain:
   - 3+ visual styles  
   - 3+ emotional tones (logical, inspirational, testimonial)  
   - 3+ hook variations per persona  

3. **Integrate Retrieval Logic into Testing SOPs**  
   - Replace “ad set per audience” with “ad pool per message.”  
   - Rotate creatives weekly to sustain retrieval freshness.

4. **Leverage Zero-Party Data from Quiz Funnels**  
   Combine the personalization frameworks from `quiz_philosphy.md` with Andromeda’s retrieval logic.  
   → The quiz data teaches Meta *who* resonates with *which* message.

5. **Feed Mechanisms, Not Features**  
   Focus each creative on **how** your offer works — the retrieval model thrives on semantic clarity.

## 🚀 6. Practical Translation for AI Projects

When building funnels or training our AI systems inside this project:
- **Treat creatives as training data**, not assets.  
- Use AI to **generate creative variants**, simulate personas, and predict response clusters.  
- Map each creative back to:
  - Awareness level  
  - Mechanism theme  
  - Emotional state (high vs. low)  

This mirrors Andromeda’s retrieval scoring and ensures every output feeds the same learning loop Meta uses.

---

## 🧾 7. TL;DR

**Andromeda = Retrieval > Targeting**  
Creative is the new audience.  
Diversity is the new optimization.  
Mechanism storytelling is the new copywriting edge.  

The more structured, diverse, and semantically rich our creative pools — the stronger Meta’s retrieval model performs in our favor.

Think about it like the olympic rings and multi-vendiagram structure that create.

you might have a UGC testimonail
You might have a demonstrative version of the product
you might hav ea fun edited video talking about deatures and benefits and while ppl like it xyz
then you might have a static image below that overcomes the objections of the ugc and the demonstrative or maybe you talk about benefits features pricing structure etc
then bottom left where you have features benefits/demonstrative, here you can talk about testimonials

Those are 5 different conepts, that creative diversity is all you need to interact with a very spefific kind of user

and the way you sale a business is by getitng the kind of user thats likely to spend money with you more than once
very big difference between being a sales person and having a business
being a buinses means you acquire cash flow profitably in a scalable fashion
the more ads you have the harder it is to get to the "Second Scale"
the point is creative diversity is not any # of ads.. it's different concepts that are complimentary with eachother
then you can nail that diversity with half a dozen ads
and then you can do creative testing to try and improve the quality of thsoe elemens inside investment portfolio

THis is about creating an ECOSYSTEM of ads that are complimentary to eachother

It sayd produce DIFFERENT KINDS
More ads does not solve the retreival problem, more does not make things simpler
more assets with less data only makes thing worse
dont leverage a smarter machine by making it dumber, leverage a smarter machine by giving it better choices




Dont need seperate campaign or seperate adsets

the personas can all exist in the same thing, and your ads should just be speaking multiple types of people and tihnk of your campaign like an ecosystem

Campaigns dont talk to each other
personas are not discreet,
youre not just talking to completely different people there is going to be overlap
every bit of overlap is keeps the machine dumb and you focus on attribution to make poor decisions based off retroactive data that is incomplete

we are keeping the machine dumb to justify an effort of performance efficiency on first order and this ultiiamtely cripples your growth.

It's not trying to find the best ad for the right person because every ad makes the sale on the first touch

youre triyn to find the right journey on multiple touchpoints of ads

its ALL of your ads, and all of your organic content + everyone else in your niche and everyone else marketing all colelctively bringing someone to one toiuchpoint, a customer journey is way more than one sale, it's way more than 1 day, it's way more than 1 week.

The reason you have tgh eshoes youre wearing now isnt becuase of a slaes pitch, its because youve been buying shoes for decades

ITs about the entire portfolio of ads creating their own ecosystem

Each campaign is a discreet data set that does not communicate, so each campaign is essentially competing against eachother to achieve the sam end goal

Having multiple campaigns = dumber machine

Only have a seprate campaign if you hvae a seprate business objective

that seperate business obj better have a different KPI target

CASH FLOW
Buy as many customers that are likely to buy a 2nd time
m

PRIFOTIABLILT
GPT Campaign to give us a higher day 1 profitably so we can lose more money on the aqcuisition of new customers - essentially setting up a socialism that allows you to afford long flow cash flow cycles

maybe you have a volume of transaction advice to bring down the blended cpa wiht the catalouge

thats 3 campaigns and will easily get you to 5 figures

anything else is going ot get in the way of that..


Campaign structure needs to be very simple.
Multiple campaigns inside of an ad account dont talk to each other, theyre all separate data points

It's much better to keep the same campaign and adset constantly put in new creative. 

That brings the question to "When should we make a new campaign, what defines making a new campaign vs keep refreshing creative?"


Now, the problem we're having currently is - instead of looking at a problem, creating a hypothesis - and trying to solve said problem...
we basically say "i have a new idea, lets throw it into the randomizer, and see if it makes things better."

Its just not a valuable way of "testing" or rather a much less valuable and less data driven way of testing. 

I always saw what you meant eddy.. I just didnt know how to test properly.

The learning phaes doesnt decrease performance, the learning phase is telling you that it has enough data to have statistical signifiance and confidence in delivering a consistent user experience

when you ad new ads in and massively ramp up the permutations, it no longer has that statistical significance
Youre not trying to avoid the learning phase by hacking it, it's a signal that youve made too many choices

Control
DTC1
DTC2

The learning phase goes into DTC1 and DTC2 and doesnt go into the winners

youre variables ahve to overcome the uncertainty in otder to contribute to the bottom line, but the CONTROL DOESNT

This solves the problem of when wanting to try a new idea, you risk the stability of the entire business.

PRINCIPLES OF SCALING OR CHANGING THINGS

If your results are good enough to increase your budget - dont launch new ads
If you have ads that earn spend and your performance isnt good enough, turn off the ad that is contributing to that detriment
# Removing complexity is a better solution than making the system dumber - MORE ADS = DUMBER
More places that you have to invest with less data behind them is a dumber machine - who cares about the potential
If you have a ton of potential but havent been trained then youre under leveraged.

The idea of creating more complexity to further underleverage a machine as a way of solving a problem doesnt make sense

Its so much easier to remove bad choices and to then understand where your weakness is to insert a stronger option to improve your weakest link

At the end of the day I dont want 1k different ICPs we already have an ICP
If we have 1 2 or 3 of those thats an easy enough to get to 6 figures a week

If you have 5-10 personas youre going to struggle to get to 6 figures per month

Specalists make more $

We dont want a generalist approach just to see "what gets lucky"


Turn off ads where CPA is above avergae and GPT is below - youre paying more for something of less value

The ads that dont spend still might be valuable 

The ads that earn budget early are ones that based on existing data, the machine had higher confidence and ability to deliver consistent result
- problem with this style is youre basically serving ads to the same folks over and over again so youre going to struggle to find new customers because youre prefacing the machine to only focus on the data you already have so this is a far less incremental approach because youre effectively punishing any incrementality by turning off the ads that dont get spend


If your performance is good - dont turn off an ad 
- if youve solved the problem of "can i spend more $$" the worse thing you can do is change the investment portoflio

if you have a machine that works, dont fix the machine, because you dont have a problem
you need to create a problem of adding load or more spend, to see where it breaks. But if its not broken dont fix it
