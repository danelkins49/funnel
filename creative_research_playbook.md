# 🧠 Creative Research & Ad Angle Playbook
This playbook distills key frameworks and tactics for generating high-performing Facebook ad creatives. It’s designed for quick reference when researching markets, crafting angles, and planning creative testing.

---

## 🔍 1. Market Research Methodology

### Core Channels
- **Reddit / Quora / Google** → Gather unfiltered market feedback and real conversations.  
- **Meta Ad Library** → Audit competitors’ ads to gauge *market sophistication*, creative types, and positioning trends.

### What to Look For
- **Trends & Patterns** → Common formats (e.g., before/after transformations for Invisalign).  
- **Audience Voice** → Complaints, recurring concerns, and desired benefits.  
- **Competitor Density** → How many advertisers are active, and which creative angles dominate.

### “I Want” Statements
Convert insights into **“I want to…”** phrasing for ad concepts:
- “I want a pain-free treatment.”  
- “I want a non-intrusive way of fixing my teeth.”  
- “I want a cost-effective way to fix my smile.”  
- “I want a stain-free result.”  
→ These statements become *the backbone of hooks and angles*.

## 🧍 2. Persona & Awareness Framework

### 5 Levels of Market Awareness

| Level | Prospect State | Headline Strategy |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1. **Unaware** | Doesn’t know or admit their need | Echo dissatisfaction — sell nothing, promise nothing |
| 2. **Problem Aware** | Knows the problem, not the solution | Name & dramatize the problem; make your product the inevitable fix |
| 3. **Solution Aware** | Knows the desired outcome, unaware of your product | Show that your product contains the mechanism to deliver the solution |
| 4. **Product Aware** | Knows your product but hasn’t converted | Reinforce desires, add proof, highlight new mechanisms |
| 5. **Most Aware** | Ready to buy | Name product + price. Bottom-of-funnel conversion focus |

> 💡 *Most ads operate between levels 3–4. Awareness level determines the sophistication of your hook and headline.*

## 📈 3. Market Sophistication Stages

| Stage | Description | Headline / Angle Focus |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1. **First to Market** | Prospect has never seen this before | Simple & direct. Name the claim, dramatize it, then prove it. |
| 2. **Second to Market** | Competitor exists, product still “new” | Enlarge competitor’s successful claim, outbid them on acquisition. |
| 3. **Heard It All** | Market is saturated with claims | Introduce a **new mechanism** — focus on *how* it works. |
| 4. **Crowded Mechanism** | Competitors copied your mechanism | Embellish or extend the mechanism to solve *more* of the problem. Eventually, either reinvent or move on. |
| 5. **Dead Product** | Market tuned out | Use *identification* instead of desire. Show who they want to become, not just what they get. Visuals matter here. |
