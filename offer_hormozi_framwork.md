## 4. Trim & Stack (High Value, Low Cost)

Focus on items that feel high-value to the buyer but cost little to deliver.  
Stack these to increase perceived value without bloating real cost.

### üíé Examples of High-Value / Low-Cost Elements
- Pre-recorded video trainings or checklists  
- Private group challenges or leaderboards  
- Swipe files or ‚Äúcheat sheets‚Äù  
- Templates, macros, or workout libraries  
- Access to community Q&A calls  
- Personalized welcome videos or milestone badges  
- Tiered rewards for progress completion  

> Most people only stack *free* bonuses ‚Äî but the real power is in adding **low to medium cost** items that feel *exclusive*.
