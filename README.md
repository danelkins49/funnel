# 🌀 Funnel

A living library of frameworks, hooks, strategies, and research systems for creating, testing, and optimizing high-conversion sales funnels.  
This repo serves as both a **knowledge base** and **creative engine** for funnel architecture — from awareness to action.

---

## 🚧 Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Document **tested frameworks** for funnel creation and iteration.  
- Store **hook formulas**, **copywriting patterns**, and **quiz logic** for personalized experiences.  
- Organize **research templates** for audience analysis, product-market fit, and competitive insights.  
- Act as a **reference layer** that future automations or tool integrations can plug into.

## 💡 Vision

Eventually, this repo will connect into a broader **“Funnel Operating System”**, allowing:
- Rapid funnel builds from standardized templates.  
- Easy syncing between idea → copy → page.  
- Collaborative testing of angles, hooks, and offers.  

Right now, it’s simply a **knowledge and creative repository** — but the direction is toward automation, adaptability, and repeatable success.

---

## 📘 Current Focus

- Organizing and tagging existing frameworks.  
- Building naming conventions for readability and reuse.  
- Mapping integration paths with future tooling (ClickUp, GitHub Actions, etc.).

## 🪴 Status

Early stage. Documentation and organization in progress.  
Think of this as the **seed of a larger system** that will grow alongside your workflow.
